# GenotypeFitnessSim

Original program written by professor Meisel, and translated to python by Martin Elias. Labeled "MultiProcessingCode.py"
  inside folder Y1Y2W.
Later revisions to this program and more complex versions created by me. 

The purpose of these programs is to track the sex determining alleles in house flyâ€™s. Each simulation is placed in a separate
  row in the table containing the allele frequencies and any additional information that was used or created during the 
  process. These tables can then be used to compare to real world populations.

Detailed description of how these programs run can be found in Folder "Y1Y2W" README.txt
